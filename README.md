![rails Infinite Scroll](https://i.ibb.co/2ZsCWts/20230913-144634.gif)

This application is a example of how to implement a infinite scroll with Rails and Turbo. 

We also explore two complementary gems, [ActionText](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/main/actiontext) and [Active Record Import](https://github.com/zdennis/activerecord-import).

To demonstrate the use of all features, we developed a simple blog application. 
The articles can be generated with a simple seed, and the body of the article is a rich text field.

The index of application is a infinite scroll with the articles.
